# Data Structures and Algorithms 🚀

This repository contains my personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems and solutions. It is created as part of my learning journey to improve problem‑solving skills, logical thinking, and coding efficiency.

The solutions are written with a focus on **clarity, correctness, and optimization**, making this repository useful for revision, interview preparation, and consistent practice.
